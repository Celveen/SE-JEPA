The appendix starts on a separate page after the references. The source includes
vector figures, selected original simulator frames, numerical snapshots, and
scripts for rebuilding the figures. Compile `main.tex` with pdfLaTeX and BibTeX.

Section 3.1 motivates cross-episode replay using the paired weight-inheritance experiment. Main Table 2 gives the matched-goal accumulation diagnostic. Section 4.1 and Appendix C describe the evaluation protocols and identify the published PushObj Unseen and deformable results in the main table. Figure 1 pairs the recurring-shift schematic with held-out GD success. Figure 1 uses the three-chain GD mean for SE-JEPA. The main table uses the CEM state collection documented in Appendix B. Section 4.5 studies removal of the familiarity checks and compares replay with weight inheritance under a common initial checkpoint. Main Table 3 includes the fixed slow learning rate sweep.

The revised layout places the main table on page 5 and all main result figures
before Conclusion on page 8. Figure 7 shows the goal-success gains for each shape and visual shift. The bibliography contains 42 cited references;
Appendix A records the author-supplied 8-GPU RTX 5090 and A100 compute systems.

The backbone discussion distinguishes task-trained ResNet models on PushObj/PushT
from DINO-WM on rope/granular. Main Figure 6 presents five-round unseen-shape
and color-shift success together with four-pass rope/granular CD. Its archived
counts and uncertainty definitions are in `data/learning_progress.json` within
the source project. Future work includes improving planning as prediction
accuracy and behavioral performance become decoupled later in deployment.
